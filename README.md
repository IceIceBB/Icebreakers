##Requirements / Constraints

Your work must:

- Have at least one Activity--more if it makes sense. The activity should include a list of interactive cards implemented with Android’s RecyclerView and CardView APIs.
- Include at least three types of cards:

  - One card should present data that is stored and updated on the user’s phone using a Content Provider or Shared Preferences (e.g. To-do card, Reminder card, Alarm card).
  - Two cards should present data provided through a web API (e.g. Weather card, Twitter card, Maps card, Photo of the Day). Check out [this directory of APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) if you need some API ideas.

- Use the [Retrofit library](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle HTTP requests and parse JSON data
- Include at least one Notifications feature (e.g. reminder, alarm)
- Look great in both landscape and portrait modes and reflect Material Design principles
- Not crash or hang and should handle for when networking/internet is slow or unavailable
- Have code that is semantically clean and well-organized
- Integrate with the Twitter and/or Facebook's APIs
- Allow the user to share breaking news developments with friends

**Bonus:**
